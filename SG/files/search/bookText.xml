                                             here’s a frisson of excitement in fashion right now. It’s not as obvious
                          as the Barbie-core moment that turned the world pink for a month or two. It’s a lot subtler—
                          this melding of sexes where men and women are experimenting with interchangeable
                          wardrobes. It started a couple of summers back with the whole baby T and cropped tops
                          moment. That style developed into tank tops for everyone, which then became strategic
                          cut-outs on barely there clothes, with skirts, eyeliner and nail polish for all genders.
                          I’ve seen the men in my team blossom as they raid the beauty and fashion closets for inspo. Joe,
                          our social media manager thinks nothing of toting his Birkin with knee-high boots, short shorts
                          and bling on every finger, for a 10am meeting in the office. Ditto, Brandon, our newly appointed
                          content producer who wears dazzling suits, sparkling necklaces and brooches—all with the
                          highest heels. Navin, our digital content manager, has a manicure Paris Hilton would die for and
                          his visage is always flawless, as is his mostly monochromatic wardrobe. Jeffrey, our associate
                          fashion director, loves a filmy oversize blouse buttoned only below the navel, with his shock of
                          curly locks always purposefully dishevelled. Even our creative director, Windy, a proud married
                          father of two boys, is not against lining his eyes and curling his amazing lashes for the camera
                          when the occasion calls for it.
                             Some may say this feminisation of menswear has taken years to happen, but I have seen and
                          experienced it for decades—it was just never celebrated the way it is now. So, when Jeffrey raised
                          his hand to write about how an injection of womenswear codes into the realm of menswear is
                          making men chicer than ever, I applauded. Read ‘All in the Femme’ on page 150 which charts the
                          rise and rise of a softer, more spirited man. A guy who’s in touch and in love with showing a li’l
                          Fendi shoulder here (ahem, that’s me), or a lot of Saint Laurent chest there. The women on my
                          team, on the other hand, are storming into the office with Prada combat boots, oversize tees and
                          big baggy cargoes. In contrast, their faces are painted with silver liner, lots of blush and a cupid’s
                          bow lip in matte berry. It’s refreshing to see such a wonderful kaleidoscope of styles. Even the
                          biggest fashion houses are no longer pushing out trend after trend. Instead, they are going back
                          to the hallmarks of what make them so special—Chanel’s tweed, Saint Laurent’s Le Smoking,
                          Hermès’ quiet luxury, McQueen’s tailoring, Prada’s simplicity and Dolce’s lingerie dressing. Our
                          extensive ‘Collections Report,’ page 78, details how fabulous, considered and meaningful fashion   PHOTOGRAPHY: PHYLLICIA WANG. MAKEUP: MANISA TAN. HAIR: KAROL SOH. TOP; TROUSERS, FENDI. JEWELLERY AND ACCESSORIES,

             It has been said that we live in an attention economy, where power and influence are often determined by what grabs and
              arrests us most fully, whether it’s a 30-second TikTok video, a stirring performance, a transporting piece of writing, or a


              call for justice. That’s why where we choose to invest our attention is so vitally important. The individuals in this year’s
            Icons portfolio are people who command it. They captivate us, connect us, entertain us, move us, stoke our obsession, and


             inspire us with the urgency they bring to their work. They not only speak to this moment, they are also helping to define it
            and give it meaning. They’ve each made their marks—and some of them might be making history. But most importantly,


              they all understand what can happen when our eyes, hearts, minds, and energies are all pointed in the same direction.

                                                   a dose of flower power
                                 From the beginning of their careers—and then later, their
                                 partnership—Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons have always had a
                                 contrarian way of looking at beauty, often ﬁnding it in the most
                                 unexpected of places. This season, the designers looked to the
                                     utilitarian—elevating the oft-overlooked with couture gestures
                                        and craft. Nurses’ uniforms were elongated and given
                                          trains, while army parkas came with gently curved
                                            backs. The duo also turned their eye to the
                                             humble slingback ﬂat, a practical shoe turned

            THE





































































            The fall/winter 2023 season is marked by a
            definitive shift away from fantasy fashion. Instead,
            designers traced the roots of their brands to chart
            their paths forward. The result is considered,
            meaningful fashion that not only addresses what
            women want to wear today, but suggests new ways
            to see and move through the world. By Jeffrey Yan

            After a blockbuster three-season run

            redeﬁning what sexy looks like, Miuccia
            Prada has pivoted to… normcore. Of course,
            in Prada’s hands, nothing is ever quite what

            it seems. The ﬁrst section seemed to riff  on
            the ladylike uniforms of the bourgeoisie—
            twinsets, camel coats, polka dots. But the tops
            were tucked into briefs that have been hiked
            up above the skirts, the models’ hair were
            balloon-static frazzled, and some of them
            have skipped bottoms entirely to step out just
            in their underwear. Not quite prim and proper.

            Then came a different kind of uniform—a boxy
            coat worn over a hoodie worn over a sweater
            worn over a t-shirt; again, pants optional. The
            pieces were double-bonded, creating a gently
            padded effect. Finally, Emma Corrin closed

            the show in sparkly gold panties and a camel
            knit—the epitome of unbothered and fabulous.

                      Vanhee-Cybulski is in prime position to take advantage of this pendulum
                      swing. After all, her work for Hermès has always been rooted in subtlety.
                      This season, her Hermès woman is all about softness and sensuality. But at
                      Hermès, sensuality is expressed not through the amount of skin on show.
                      The body remained mostly covered, though very much highlighted through
                      the use of adjustable collars, soft belts, and scarves that gently wrap and
                      drape around the ﬁgure. These were applied onto plush knits, classic coats
                      and pleated lamé dresses. Vanhee-Cybulski’s rich palette was drawn from
                      nature—the hues of dawns and sunsets, but also of human hair. Think reds
                      and coppers, chestnuts and straw. Throughout, there was a faint shimmer—
                      achieved through sparkling fabrics and ultra-ﬁne beading.

                            fedoras and skinny scarves; military jackets and knee-high
                            boots; minidresses sequinned and ruffled; little vests and big


                            furs, and even bigger bags tucked into the crook of the elbow.
                            Slimane ended on a note of glamour, with a series of slip
                            gowns—minimal in silhouette, but glittering all over in beads
                            and sequins. A lot of people are attempting Y2K, but no one
                            does it as convincingly—and as sexily—as Slimane.

               Jonathan Anderson continues his winning streak of marrying surrealism to minimalism.
               These days, the designer trades in the subtle instead of the fantastical. His fall/winter
               2023 collection was about gestures: a shirtdress was draped to be asymmetrical but
               made to look like it was caught in the chain of a bag; an ivory gown looked as though it

               would slip off the model’s body if she wasn’t clutching it close; creases and folds were
               built into clothes; boots went beyond slouchy and actually collapsed. Most evocative of
               all were the dresses, trench coats and fur coats printed onto plain silk duchesse. Blurred
               and with their white edges showing, the pieces brought to mind ghosts of garments
               past, turned into something new.

                Anatomy. It was a 55-look structural study
                of the human body, of clothing, and of

                ﬂowers. With the collection, Burton also
                traced the roots of the House—McQueen
                himself cut his teeth on Savile Row, and
                tailoring was a particular focus here. Sharp
                suits were either presented straight-up,
                or subverted through slashing, slicing
                and twisting. The body was mostly
                covered up, but even when revealed,
                there was an armour-like quality to the
                pieces that adorned it. Volumes were
                kept strict and severe, or exploded into
                unfurling silhouettes that evoked orchids.
                Meanwhile, the monochromatic palette
                was interjected occasionally by deep
                purples, rich reds and lustrous silvers.

                 This season, Maria Grazia Chiuri was inspired by a trio of
                 women: Catherine Dior, Edith Piaf and Juliette Greco. They
                 were post-war Parisiennes who lived liberated lives for their
                 time; feminine, but also independent and strong. The resulting
                 collection featured classic New Look silhouettes—full skirts,
                 nipped-in jackets—in ultra-light, crinkled fabrics that gave
                 them an air of nonchalance, making them feel contemporary
                 almost 80 years after their creation. Bra tops and t-shirts
                 further modernised the look. The palette was mostly black,
                 occasionally shot through with muted jewel tones of ruby,
                 emerald and topaz. There were also plenty of beautifully
                 simple day dresses, knits, shirts and skirts that proved that
                 fashion doesn’t always have to be shouty to be eff ective.

            a harder edge to the British
            label, Daniel Lee, in his debut

            softer look—one more playful
            and romantic, and undeniably
            English. It is an aesthetic
            rooted in the great outdoors,
            the country houses and the

            rolling ﬁelds around them, the
            unpredictable weather. The
            classic trench coat has been
            loosened up, with exaggerated
            faux-fur lapels; the signature
            check, knocked askew and
            rendered in bright hues. Other
            key prints included roses and
            ducks, while accessories ranged
            from furry trapper hats and
            moccasins to hot water bottles in
            Burberry check. Elsewhere, Lee
            doubled down on Britishness via
            blanket coats, Aran and argyle
            knits, and tartan kilts.                                     BU

                        His fall/winter 2023 collection was inspired

            theatrical, coinciding with the rise of Instagram

            from their archives, has perhaps reminded them
            of the classics that turned them into household

            names in the ﬁrst place. This season, they
            doubled down. Titled “Sensuale,” the collection
            dived deep into their greatest hits. The opening

            was all black lace and sheer black chiffon, and a
            smattering of crystals. Tailoring was a particular
            highlight—sharp and snatched in all the right
            places. As a counterpoint, there was lingerie
            dressing galore—a look the duo pioneered
            decades ago and which looks just as fresh now.

            bags) and small (camellia hairpins); and it adorned
            jackets and knits, pockets and buttons. Viard also
            loves her shorts; it’s her design shorthand for women
            being unencumbered. This season, her shorts
            silhouette of choice is the nonchalant Bermuda,
            which she showed in both tweed and denim.
            Asymmetry was another key feature of the collection,
            from the way the coats fell to the way skirts were slit.

                                                 Every collection that Demna sends down the
                                                 runway is ﬁercely watched, but for this, the stakes

                                                 were higher than ever. His fall/winter 2023 collection
                                                 came on the heels of a turbulent period that
                                                 threatened to halt the red-hot trajectory of one
                                                 of Kering’s star brands. Demna’s response was to
                                                 strip everything back—no giant sets, no
                                                 meta commentary—and focus purely
                                                 on the clothes. And what clothes! The
                                                 opening was a series of severe black
                                                 suits, onto which he affi  xed cut-up

                                                 trousers that ﬂowed around them like
                                                 a modern take on trains. There wasn’t
                                                 a single logo in sight. There were
                                                 hoodies, but they were distorted beyond
                                                 recognition. Demna’s most impressive
                                                 technical accomplishment though, were
                                                 the pinched, rounded shoulders that
                                                 stood away from the body—they were
                                                 especially alluring on the embroidered
                                                 gowns that closed the show.

                                                     Anthony Vaccarello has been an acolyte

                                                     uniform might be her most extreme—and
                                                     alluring—yet. And make no mistake, it is a
                                                     uniform; Vaccarello is the kind of designer
                                                     who hammers home a single silhouette over
                                                     the course of a 50-look show. For his latest
                                                     show, that silhouette consists of a blazer with
                                                     monolithic shoulders, worn over a plunging silk
                                                     tank and a ﬁtted skirt that hits right above the

                                                     knees. There is also the occasional pussybow
                                                     or blanket scarf—both in such exaggerated
                                                     proportions that they trail on the ground. Judging
                                                     by the commercial juggernaut that the brand has
                                                     become under his stewardship, Vaccarello’s
                                                     go-big-or-go-home vision is clearly resonating.

                                       Miuccia Prada changed the
                                       fashion agenda in the Nineties
                                       when she rejected glamour
                                       in favour of an off -kilter
                                       minimalism that was almost
                                       radical in its simplicity. She’s
                                       done it again this season,
                                       now with Raf Simons as her
                                       co-conspirator. The restraint
                                       the duo showed in their latest
                                       collection was refreshing in
                                       the face of so much fashion
                                       engineered for virality. The ﬁ rst
                                       look out was a grey crewneck
                                       knit, worn with a slim white
                                       calf-length skirt. More plain knits
                                       in navy and camel followed, as
                                       did those embroidered skirts
                                       but in mini and A-line variations.
                                       The highlight was a quartet of
                                       crisp white dresses that reached
                                       down to the ﬂ oor—inspired by
                                       nurses’ uniforms, but imbued
                                       with so much grace they
                                       became something else entirely.

                                                             Hepburn. It wasn’t a faithful reproduction of period costume though;

                                               From the moment he started at the Roman brand, Kim Jones has
                                               been inspired by the founding family. Today, that means not only
                                               Silvia Venturini Fendi but also her daughter, Delﬁna Delettrez Fendi,

                                               “chicness but a perversity to the way she twists Fendi.” Those
                                               two qualities became the twin pillars of this new collection, which
                                               was ladylike yet subversive, elegant yet nonchalant. The palette
                                               consisted of menswear blues and matronly browns. Masculine
                                               tailoring and fabrics were twisted into feminine forms. Glamour was
                                               shot through with utilitarianism—jumpsuits, aprons and uniforms
                                               shown side by side with lace and leathers. An unassuming trench
                                               opens up to reveal gold sequinned lining, while goddess gowns
                                               come with harness straps.

            everything is black, caramel, or grey, with
            a few snaps of orange and electric blue.
            The silhouettes are gently cocooned and
            rounded, with squarish but
            unexaggerated shoulders; the waistlines
            nipped in.
               It’s a marked departure from the
            logo-laden clothes Versace has been
            doing for several seasons. As she says,
            with all the chaos in the world, “we need
            to be more …” She searches for the word,
            and someone from the design team
            throws out “elevated.”
               “Bravo,” Versace says. “Elevated!”
               “It’s all about less,” she says. “Which
            is a word I never use!”
               These are the clothes that led
            Princess Diana to call up Gianni and ask
            him for a makeover in 1994. The people’s
            princess, freshly separated from Prince
            Charles and in the throes of the publicity
            furor in its fallout, reminded everyone
            that she had a role to play, as both a
            mother and a public ﬁgure who could
            project a certain standard of elegance
            and humanity. She looked powerful in
            Gianni’s suits but still so graceful, so soft.

               Versace is one of the few designers remaining who is a

                                                              Arnault took the reins of Louis
                                                              Vuitton’s watch division. And this
                                                             is evident in the Tambour watch, which
                                                            debuted in 2002, and is now presented
                                                            in two steel versions—tonal grey and deep
                                                           blue. “With this launch, we seek to open a new
                                                        chapter in the history of the Maison’s watchmaking
                                   by creating a watch with strong horological credentials while identifiably Louis
                                  Vuitton in style,” says Arnault. While the signature drum-shaped case remains, the
                                  new models sport a compact 8.3mm thick case with a unisex 40mm diameter and
                                  a slight curvature on the back following the contour of the wrist—an understated
                                 but significant ergonomic detail. The new Tambour also features an integrated, lug-
                                 free bracelet with an invisible closure that defines the sleek aesthetic that harks back
                                  to the Maison’s avant-garde style. Likewise, the dial is updated with split-level chapter
                                  rings—an outer ring for the minutes and an inner ring for the hours—creating depth
                                   and differently levelled dial markers that are easy on the eyes. Within is the new
                                    micro-rotor calibre LFT023 in high-inertia 22K gold with a 50-hour power
                                     reserve, and a certified timekeeping accuracy of -4 seconds and +6 seconds
                                       per day. This is the first proprietary automatic three-hand movement
                                        by Louis Vuitton, La Fabrique du Temps and in conjunction with
                                           Le Cercle des Horlogers. The launch of these two pieces will
                                             be accompanied by three more models so as to bridge
                                                the old and the new for experienced collectors
                                                     and budding enthusiasts.

            what are some of your biggest challenges, as well
            as the greatest highlights?
            Heritage is more than the archives. Archives is one part,
            but as far as archives are concerned, the traditional
            challenges you have is the protection of the contents.
            But this started a long time ago. Already in the
            Seventies, we went into a process of microﬁlming. And
            of course, for the last 25 years, we have entered into
            digitalisation. So now everything is computerised.

            Tell us about Le Voyage Recommencé. What is the
            ethos and inspiration behind this collection?
            Everything started with our intention to display and to
            share our contemporary vision in terms of design. And
            we have a more advanced evolution in terms of the
            creation of new shapes and new association of colours
            to show our contemporary vision. And we felt that it
            was even more visible if we took the existing ﬁelds of
            expression or traditional ﬁelds of expression, like the
            inspiration we take for instance, from other cultures,
            other civilisations, or the importance of geometry or
            the importance of nature and things.
















                                                              Clockwise from left:   There are over 80 pieces in Le Voyage Recommencé.

                                                                              speciﬁc approach of this collection and the Cartier
                                                                              spirit. For instance, the Girih. This piece is inspired by
                                                                              Islamic art, but the idea was not to go to the archives
                                                                              to see a previous Islamic art-inspired Cartier piece.
                                                                              It’s a new proposal, a new thing. So, of course, you
                                                                              recognise the blue and green that resonates with
                                                                              Cartier. You recognise the geometry that comes
                                                                              from Islamic art, some combinations, but the result is
                                                                              totally new and nothing to do with the previous pieces
                                                                              coming from that kind of inspiration. So, I think this is
                                                                              a good example of a collection.
                                                                                 And there’s another piece I like also because it’s
                                                                              very emblematic. It’s Distrysia. I think it shows many
                                                                              Cartier speciﬁcities. First, the choice of a stone itself
                                                                              I think is a particularity at Cartier—to go for stones
                                                                              that are totally unusual. And in the colour, because the

                                                        colour makes it not the most precious diamond, but it makes it very interesting,
                                                        very different. The second point is it also shows that in our philosophy, the
                                                        stones lead the design. So, the necklace is entirely linked to a speciﬁc shape—
                                                        something asymmetrical. We know that harmony can come from something that
                                                        is not symmetrical and this is also something interesting, and it also shows many
                                                        principles that are essential to Cartier. For instance, the idea of perfect ﬂuidity of
                                                        a piece that is achieved with many different little parts assembled together. And
                                                        then these little shapes give an illusion of Egyptian scarab wings that were used in
                                                        the past in our designs. And the mix of colours—to clash lapis lazuli with diamonds.
                                                        The result is a totally new design: something that never existed before yet keeps
                                                        the philosophy and the principles of Cartier.

                                                        When you talk about the weight of a piece of jewellery, do people appreciate
                                                        if it’s lighter or heavier?
                                                         This is a very interesting point because I think there should be a right balance. It
                                                        shouldn’t be an inconvenience. It shouldn’t be too heavy, but when it’s light, it’s a
                                                        problem because people don’t feel it. And I think there’s a pleasure in feeling the
                                                        presence, a certain weight.
                                                           We know that we cannot go beyond a certain weight. Of course, there are
                                                        pieces, by essence, that cannot be heavy. Like earrings. We have some weight,
                                                        and the earrings are very technical, even in terms of the orientation and the way
                                                        the motif is oriented with the clasp. So it’s a precise question of degrees. And then
                                                        again, constraint might be an opportunity because the movement leads you to
                                                        invent different things. And for brooches, we should be very careful in their weight
                                                        too, because if they’re too heavy, they can only be on a tie on a man or on a very
                                                        thick jacket. The temptation with a brooch is there’s no constraint in terms of
                                                        ﬁtting your neck or your wrist or your ﬁnger. But weight plays a huge part. So you
                                                        have to be reasonable and to take that into consideration. Brooches are probably
                                                        one of the strongest statements for the wearer because of that object value. It’s
                                                        something you wear to show who you are. That’s why so many brooches are using
                                                        animal inspirations or things like that because it’s a way of being associated with
                                                        what the animal conveys and when you have the colours, you have everything.

            image, style and heritage
            director of Cartier   stones. And there are stones that are always requested
                                  by our designers and by us, because we love beautiful
                                  emeralds, beautiful rubies, beautiful diamonds... and
                                  these are classics. And then have the fancy brown
                                  diamond. In this, you have, according to the spirit of
                                  a collection, the request for stones that could better
                                  illustrate the theme of a collection. So that’s why
                                  when the theme is chosen, the hunt for stones can
                                  last for months. We start the designs when the stones
                                  are gathered. We have to have a certain number of
                                  pieces at different levels of pricing. We’re commercial
                                  people with sales staff; we say, okay, we would need
                                  more bracelets this year, more rings or more necklaces,
                                  short necklaces, long necklaces. So the designers have
                                  to play with that and when we choose the stones, the
                                  value of the stones is a part of the decision. When we
                                  pick up the stones, we have very interesting meetings
                                  with the designer where all the stones are put on the
                                  table; there’s no camera and, each of them is on paper.
                                  You have an indication of what they are, the carats and
                                  the price. The designers have in mind their objectives

                                                        Who is the woman wearing a Cartier high jewellery piece? When Cartier designs
                                                        for her, what must her jewellery be able to do for her wardrobe and lifestyle
                                                        beyond being a beautiful and wearable piece of art?
                                                         First of all, I was afraid of the beginning of your question because I don’t think
                                                        there’s one woman. It’s not linked to that and I’m always surprised by the choices
                                                        made by certain women because you never know who will buy the piece you
                                                        propose. And the lesson I get from that is that jewellery is not something you plan.
                                                        Jewellery talks to your heart: ‘Oh, I like it.’ And you don’t have a reason behind why.
                                                        It talks to you and it helps the woman to know herself better, probably through the
                                                        emotion she will feel. And that’s why I think then when this emotion is there, when
                                                        it is the moment you choose to wear it, it is so important to her that everything will
                                                        follow. If the will is there, everything will follow.






















            and when they choose the stones and when they
            choose to mix some of the stones beforehand, they
            know about the construction and approximately to
            which bracket it will lead. And that’s how a collection
            is built. So, all the parameters are taken into account.

            So, are there certain kinds of pieces or periods that
            people always ask for?
            You know, in a way, Cartier is a victim of its popularity.
            Some of the periods are very well-known, like the
            Garland style, the beginning of the 20th century, and
            the Art Deco period. And within the Art Deco period,
            the geometrical ones, the Chinese-inspired ones or
            the Egyptian ones.
               If anything, with Cartier tradition, people’s desires
            are very much  informed by pop culture and by trends,
            because you would gravitate to a piece based on what
            you’re seeing around you, subliminally, without you

                          hen it comes to feats of human endurance, climbing Mount Everest,
                          the highest point above sea level on this planet, is surely one of the
                          greatest challenges one can conquer. It’s no wonder then that the
            W Goliath of mountaineering has attracted climbers far and wide, since
            Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay ﬁrst victoriously summited it in 1953. Seven
            decades later, as thousands of climbers from around the globe have successfully
            reached the summit, Nepali mountaineer Dawa Yangzum Sherpa has been hitting
            impressive peaks of her own, both literally and metaphorically.
               Dawa Yangzum started her professional mountaineering career in 2009, and just
            three years later successfully summited Mount Everest in 2012 at the tender age of 21.
            Although one could surmise that it was her destiny to conquer mountains—she came
            from a rural village that lies 4,200m above sea level, and was thus exposed to the
            surrounding mountainous topography from a young age—her gender was something
            that could foreseeably have prevented an illustrious career, despite her skills and ability.
               While over 70 notable male mountaineers have come from Dawa Yangzum’s
            region, as a woman, she was simply not expected to follow the same path. Still, she
            deﬁed expectations. At the age of 27, Dawa Yangzum became the ﬁrst Nepali woman
            to earn the sport’s most elite title, the International Federation of Mountain Guides
            Associations (IFMGA) certiﬁcation, thus becoming the ﬁrst Nepalese woman to become
            an international mountain guide. Since 2019, she has also been a Rolex Testimonee,
            joining an expanding portfolio of other partnerships embraced by the brand’s Perpetual
            Planet Initiative. Other Testimonees include luminaries like ﬁlm director and explorer
            James Cameron and sporting heroes like Roger Federer.

               For Dawa Yangzum, beyond her awe-inspiring physicality and endurance, her   equipment. On an ice fall, Dawa Yangzum leads the pack
            mission to pass on her extensive knowledge and skills to the next generation of aspiring
            female climbers is what stands out. She has joined forces with Rolex in its Perpetual
            Planet Initiative where she ensures that young Nepali women can continue to have
            the opportunity to travel the country and also learn climbing fundamentals like safety,
            logistics, knot-tying, map-reading, geology and ﬁrst aid—all essential to their survival
            and success in mountaineering expeditions. Says Dawa Yangzum, “As a Nepali female
            climber, being supported by Rolex and its Perpetual Planet Initiative is a big deal, not
            only for me but for the Sherpa community as a whole. We’re proud to be part of the
            amazing projects Rolex supports.”
               For Dawa Yangzum climbing is a career and pursuit that teaches one so many
            important lessons and skills beyond what one may expect. “During the climb, you learn
            so many things for your life, like patience, struggle, focus and perseverance. I think that’s
            very important for these young women. Climbing encourages independence and allows
            you to get to know your body,” she says. And in the spirit of inclusivity and pulling those
            around her up, Dawa Yangzum wants to create a lasting legacy for female climbers in
            Nepal. Thus she has been running a two-week intensive ice and rock-climbing course
            for Nepali women and girls at the Khumbu Climbing Center (KCC). The Rolex Perpetual
            Planet Initiative is supporting Dawa Yangzum in her mission, giving an opportunity to
            potential mountaineers to advance their skills and build their knowledge. One such
            beneﬁciary is ultra-runner Rashila Tamang, who has since progressed to the advanced
            course at the KCC. Says Tamang, “Dawa is a strong woman. She encourages women
            mountaineers in Nepal where they receive little support. She has set an example. She’s
            a true role model.”
               Beyond teaching the women practical skills, the lessons under Dawa Yangzum
            teaches them conﬁdence and shows these female climbers what their bodies are
            truly capable of accomplishing. This great psychological and emotional transformation
            may not have been what Dawa Yangzum set out to achieve in the ﬁrst place, but it is
            a happy byproduct that highlights how crucial of an element these soft skills are. With
            this inspiring goal in mind, and a desire to mentor young women and pass on both
            her burning passion and amazing skillset to the next generation of explorers, it is no
            wonder that Dawa Yangzum has gained the support of Rolex through its Perpetual
            Planet Initiative.

               While the Perpetual Planet Initiative, ﬁrst launched in 2019, initially focused on
            individuals who contribute to a better world through the Rolex Awards for Enterprise,

            it has since expanded its portfolio to support individuals and organisations using science
            to understand and devise solutions to today’s environmental challenges. This work with
            Dawa Yangzum and Nepali female climbers is yet another way the pioneering watch
            brand is giving back, by supporting causes that may be under the radar, but are no
            less important.

           AN INJECTION OF WOMENSWEAR CODES INTO THE
              REALM OF MENSWEAR IS MAKING THE LATTER
                    CHICER THAN EVER. BY JEFFREY YAN                                       Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello fall/winter 2023









                                 alf a century ago, Yves
                                 Saint Laurent created his
                                 iconic Le Smoking and
                                 changed womenswear
                                 forever. The menswear-
                                 inspired tuxedo was
                                 first a scandal, and then                       Dior Men fall/winter 2023
                                 quickly a sensation. Now,
                                 his successor, Anthony
            Vaccarello is channelling that contrarian spirit and
            doing the inverse—applying the language of Saint
            Laurent’s womenswear into menswear. This meant silk

            and chiffon blouses, giant pussybows, ﬂ oor-sweeping
            coats, and vertiginously heeled boots. For years, Saint
            Laurent menswear has felt like, if not an afterthought,
            then just a commercial continuation of the skinny rock-
            god aesthetic put in place by Hedi Slimane. It wasn’t until
            Vaccarello tapped into the inherent femininity at the heart
            of the brand that his menswear ﬁ nally clicked.
               Vaccarello isn’t the only designer who has sensed this
            shift in the air. The interesting thing is that it’s the world’s
            biggest brands and most established designers who are
            keying into this new, more feminine mood for menswear. It’s
            almost a given that young, indie, and/or queer designers—
            your Ludovic de Saint Sernin’s and Palomo Spain’s—will
            push the boundaries of gender and identity in fashion; but
            big brands, by the very nature of their businesses, which need
            to appeal to the widest possible audiences, have a tendency to
            not rock the boat so much. This season, in menswear at least,
            that has been upended.
               At Dior Men, Kim Jones is best known for merging           Fendi fall/winter 2023
            streetwear with high fashion, and for translating Christian Dior’s
            language of French couture into menswear. For fall/winter 2023,
            he focused less on the street and more on the couture. His suits
            were soft and ﬂuid, with gently nipped-in waists, draped lapels

            and the occasional ﬂowing train. There were skirts and skirt-like

            shorts. Despite these feminine accents, the collection never read                          Fendi fall/winter 2023
            as anything other than menswear. At Fendi, Silvia Venturini Fendi
            referenced her own youth, spent dancing nights away at Studio                                                  PHOTOGRAPHY: TPG IMAGES; SHOWBIT

            54. This translated into a collection ﬁlled with disco-ready one-
            shouldered tops, scarf dressing, and a generous dose of rhinestones
            and crystals. All of it made for one of Fendi’s most interesting
            menswear outings yet.

                                                        clear dining chairs from Mermelada Estudio that accompany her one-of-a-

                                                           Sticking to a minimalist palette of black, greys and whites, as well as raw
                                                        and natural materials like wood and cement, Wu’s interior design team
                                                        played with a sense of texture to add details and tactility to the home. In lieu
                                                        of a television in the sitting area, something which Wu did not want, they
                                                        conceptualised a large feature wall that conceals a storeroom under the
                                                        stairs. They also found an artist to hand paint the wall to create a cement-like
                                                        effect that was inspired by Japanese architect Tadao Ando—a solution that
                                                        was much more efficient than tearing down and rebuilding a concrete wall.
                                                           Other organic touches help to warm up the space. The large white sofa in
                                                        the sitting area—with washable covers for practicality—surrounds a torched
                                                        wood coffee table that is still in its original, stump form. One of Wu’s friends
                                                        even counted the rings on the cross-section of the wood, and declared that it
                                                        came from a 50-year-old tree. “He’s a very mathematical guy,” she laughs.
                                                        The natural wood ﬂooring is from the time of its previous owner, but was
                                                        stained from its original, more orangey hue, to a blacker tone to modernise it
                                                        and tie in with the house’s colour scheme.

               Marble is another favourite material. It features in several places including
            the kitchen island, and a stunning feature wall in her master bathroom
            constructed from two large, symmetrically patterned marble slabs. These
            were sourced by her designers along with small details like the brushed nickel
            ﬁxtures on her taps, giving the space a soft, muted touch.
               One of the main changes that Wu made when she bought her home was
            that she removed any extraneous walls on the ﬁrst level, creating a open
            concept effect. She wanted her three-year-old son, as well as her Golden
            Retriever Mao Mao, to be able to run around freely. The living room segues
            into the dining table as well as an open kitchen. While Wu cooks regularly,
            citing steaks and crabs as some of her specialities, she did not see the need
            for a separate wet kitchen, so the space was kept clean with many items
            cleverly concealed with custom cabinetry.
               While colour is not a key feature in the home by Wu’s design, the house is
            brightened up by touches of greenery in the form of plants—both outdoor
            and indoor—to enliven the space. The ﬁrst ﬂoor boasts soaring ceilings as well
            as tall, glass windows that add to the airy feel. The windows are lined outside
            with about 40 Happiness trees that bring the outside in and also serve as a
            kind of privacy wall for the open space. Indoor plants, selected in consultation
            with The Nursery Singapore as well as Koon Lee Nursery, are thriving despite
            the low-light conditions in some areas, much to Wu’s relief.
               Along with her husband, their son, and dog, the family moved from
            Sentosa to the Holland area in order to plan ahead for her son’s enrolment in
            primary school. While Wu was reluctant to leave behind the island lifestyle
            which included daily beach walks with her dog, she has managed to
            recapture a similar sense of calm in the quiet neighbourhood. The house has
            also been designed to host visitors, with guest rooms on the second level that
            are simply but comfortably furnished, giving it a communal vibe.

            and neutral bedding in soft textiles. The

                                                           The artworks that Wu commissioned also reﬂect her practical aesthetic.
                                                        They are not sentimental pieces, but rather were designed to ﬁt the space,
                                                        whether it’s a large almost industrial 3D work in an oil-black hue or an
                                                        abstract piece that anchors a stairway landing. Wu says that if a piece doesn’t
                                                        happen to ﬁt into her next house, she would simply not bring it along. To

                                                        with fragments of broken, blue-and-white ceramics. The horse, she says, is
                                                        not related to her Chinese zodiac, but rather to her heritage. “I’m a

                                                           The same practicality extends to her collection of clothes. In her heavily
                                                        curated wardrobe, she has several little black dresses, Hermès sweaters as
                                                        well as a much-loved beaded blouse from Zara, but Wu has very little
                                                        attachment to her belongings. Instead she has an almost brutal approach to
                                                        throwing out whatever is not serving her. If she does have one material
                                                        weakness it may be bags. Her husband has gifted her most of her collection
                                                        of Hermès bags—her favourite is a Birkin that takes her to work and anywhere
                                                        she needs to be. Black, practical and chic, it could very well be a metaphor for
                                                        Wu’s minimalist personal style and spare design aesthetic that whispers
                                                        quiet luxury.

            A FEAST FOR





            THE SENSES





            Take a lavish and life-affirming passage through India with its lush
            gardens, magnificent palaces and bustling spice markets. By Lydia Slater





















































                             n the ﬁrst night of our Indian holiday, the earth moved.
                             Gazing out of the bedroom window, with its
                            panoramic views over the trees covering New Delhi’s
                           golf course, I blearily noticed that the curtains were
                         swaying back and forth. So was the bed. Then my phone
            began to ping with earthquake notiﬁcations. As my family told me crossly
            the following day, I ought to have dressed and run down the seven ﬂights
            of stairs to ﬁnd safety outdoors. Instead, I commended myself to fate, and
            the hotel’s architect, and allowed myself to be rocked gently to sleep.
               The experience set the tone for a fortnight that was as surreal as it was
            exhilarating, a sensory overload as we processed the vibrancy of the
            colours, the whirling crowds, the noises, the smells, the landscapes, the
            ﬂavours and the history of the subcontinent.

                                 Despite the familiarity of the world’s most iconic
                              monument to love, the beauty of the mausoleum made us
                              gasp. And it proved still more exquisite close-up, covered as
                              it is in marble relief panels of carved irises and tulips, and
                              inlaid with lapis lazuli, agate, carnelian and garnets. We tried
                              to imagine what it would have been like when it was
                              completed 375 years ago, studded with jewels, and
                              decorated with carpets and wall-hangings, the sunken
                              gardens full of blossoming fruit-trees.
                                 Back at the hotel for breakfast, we found three chefs in
                              our suite, laying out a table of cakes, cheese, fruit and
                              yoghurt, not to mention a miniature Taj Mahal crafted from
                              white chocolate, which we demolished in short order.
            Meanwhile, a waiter proffered mimosas, eggs Benedict and local specialities,
            including lentil-ﬂour breads ﬁlled with potato curry and eaten with sugary jalebi.
            Such a feast was not conducive to anything but digesting in regal languor but, after
            a brief power nap, it was time for the Agra Fort, where Shah Jahan, who constructed
            the mausoleum, had lived himself. This was almost as impressive, boasting an
            enormous harem, vineyards and formal gardens, and domes that were originally
            covered in gold, long since looted.
               Our third sightseeing tour of the day took us across the Yamuna River to admire
            the Taj Mahal from the other side, in the Shah’s Moonlight Gardens. An unexpectedly
            delightful excursion, we found ourselves wandering alone among the pomegranate-

                                                I couldn’t scroll through

                                           IDiptyque candle post. The
                                            glass vessels, with their signature
                                            ovals labels adorned with dancing
                                            letters are often repurposed into
                                            makeup brush holders and tiny
                                            vases—and its second life is often
                                            just as charming as its first, a
                                            testament that good design lives
                                            on, in every shape and form.
                                               Building on their rich legacy of
                                            creating captivating scents and elegant designs, Diptyque launches Les Mondes de Diptyque (The
                                            Worlds of Diptyque), a new candle collection that is not only beautifully crafted but also reﬁ llable—

                                            just what I’ve always wanted. The range of ﬁve distinct candles, each representing an enchanting
                                            blend of nature, culture and destination, opens a new chapter in the history of Diptyque candles.
                                               The design of these candles is a masterpiece in itself. Created by designer Cristina Celestino
                                            who is renown for her glasswork, intuitive sense of decoration, and a style inﬂ uenced by organic
                                            forms, each candle resembles a coloured monolith, a perfectly stacked oval glass vessel inspired by
                                            Diptyque’s iconic oval shape. When asked about the choice of material for Les Mondes de Diptyque,
                                            Celestino says, “We explored the possibility of using other materials but ultimately went with glass
                                            as its translucent quality means light is able to peek through when the candle is lit, and can be
                                            tinted to different colours. There is also the sustainable aspect of glass as it’s a raw material that

                                            can be reused over and over again.” The glass also sports three layered bands to honour the brand’s
                                            three founders—interior designer Christiane Gautrot, theatre set designer Yves
                                            Coueslant and painter Desmond Knox-Leet. The candle’s engraved glass lid
                                            reveals a scented wax block, which also functions seamlessly as a stable base
                                            for the candle. As I weigh the glass in my hand, I marvelled at how everything
                                            ﬁts together, the embossed logo on the lid and the etched text along the rim of

                                            the container—it is not hard to appreciate how distinct the design language is,
                                            all while whispering opulence in the space it occupies.
                                               Les Mondes de Diptyque is the brand’s first refillable candle, and the
                                            collection, crafted by perfumer Olivia Giacobetti, offers a range of captivating

                                            scents, each inspired by a different world. From the Renaissance gardens of

                                            Italy’s Villa Borromeo Visconti to the lush Mexican jungle of Las Pozas, and
                                            from the zen gardens of Kyoto’s Arashiyama Mountain to the historic Chinese

                                            porcelain town of Jingdezhen, and ﬁnally to the ancient Native American lands of
                                            Mesa Verde in Colorado—each candle becomes a sensory passport, transporting
                                            you to faraway places, evoking the beauty and culture of each location.
                                               Les Mondes des Diptyque is a beacon of mindful luxury, a design centrepiece   PHOTOGRAPHY: DIPTYQUE; ARISSA HA

                                          BUT IF IT INVOLVES WORK THAT I’M INVESTED IN,

                                                             THEN I CAN’T LET IT GO.


                                   Jackson Wang, the 29-year-old Hong Kong rapper and singer, has experienced the ups and downs of life, and
                                   cherishes the now. He believes that when he steps into the next decade of his life and looks back, he will reﬂect
                                   and appreciate the decade that he is riding in. In the meantime, he tells BAZAAR:
                                      “I’ve no life.”
                                      Ironic coming from someone who has been busy running around in the past year, with a packed schedule.
                                   Often, it takes a while for him to process which city he is in. Jackson confesses that he has reached a point where
                                   he is plagued by feelings of anxiety whenever his staff goes radio silent for a short while, and he would quickly
                                   text his colleagues to check if there was anything wrong. He realised he couldn’t stop, even for a moment.
                                      Jackson reveals that his entire state of being has been rather low in recent years, what with globetrotting and
                                   hopping from hotel to hotel. While he ﬁnds happiness in meeting the audience and fans when he is performing,
                                   he is also gripped by a sense of emptiness when the performance ends and he returns to his room. “With only
                                   my team with me, I would start to think about many things. I would feel quite empty, as if nothing is reliable and
                                   that I can only rely on myself.”
                                      Without a social life and his family with him, Jackson ﬁnds himself turning inwards—his overactive mind, his
                                   closest companion.
                                      At 16, Jackson took part in a 2016 audition by South Korean music label JYP Entertainment in Kowloon, and
                                   came out tops, out of 2,000 applicants. He became a trainee under the label, and started his two-and-a-half-
                                   year-long training in Korea. In 2014, he debuted as a member of the boy band GOT7.
                                      In 2015, as he became increasingly popular, Jackson partnered with Chinese host He Jiong, for a talk show
                                   called Go Fridge. At the age of 21, the project was his ﬁrst as a solo artist. In one of the show’s episodes, viewers
                                   were delighted to see Jackson childishly ﬁghting with Chinese singer Wowkie Zhang over a bottle of soda.
                                   Jackson, with nary a care for his growing status as a singer-idol, candidly blurted out that he has short legs and
                                   that he didn’t have a well-built body. That disarming outburst from a very young, pretty-faced Jackson quickly
                                   earned him the title “everyone’s younger brother.”
                                      Since then, Jackson has made a name for himself as a singer and a host in variety shows. And unlike many
                                   in the industry, Jackson’s rise in the entertainment industry is not meteoric, neither is it dogged by controversy.
                                   Instead, his has been a steady climb up the fame ladder—no easy feat to achieve given the highly critical
                                   environment. Even those unfamiliar with pop culture seldom have negative feelings towards him as he comes
                                   across as likeable, a trait not commonly seen among celebrities.
                                      Thinking back on his time on Go Fridge, Jackson says, “I was young then”. Now that he is 29 going on 30, he
                                   is facing his own existential crisis, “I’m really tired and I’m on the verge of passing out,” he laments.
                                      “Everyone has their own stance and their own role to play. I feel that since I debuted almost a decade ago,
                                   I can't compromise anymore.” Perhaps driven by a sense of crisis, but more so by his expectations of himself,
                                   Jackson adds, “Even if I fail, I want to create my own music,” and this, he explains, includes an album, followed by
                                   a concert. This mindset set the stage for the conception of his ﬁrst album, Magic Man.” The album revolves around
                                   the theme of “raw,” meaning “to let go of everything in search of my authentic self,” and he hopes that listeners
                                   would be able to “ﬁnd your own magic.” In the 10-track album, Jackson divulged that he was actively involved
                                   in the composition of every track. He reveals, “Previously I didn’t spend much time on music, and I used to think
                                   that people around me were not really interested in what I was doing. At that time, we only had two and a half
                                   months, and everyone said it was impossible to do it; also not many helped, but still, I managed to complete it.”
                                      To Jackson, Magic Man is indeed something that he has always wanted to do. “Two years ago, I would not
                                   have thought about it, neither would I care about anything. I just wanted to be in control and to take a chance
                                   with my own choices. I can’t be doing this when I’m in my ﬁfties, so I can’t afford to delay any longer. Even if I
                                   fail, then let me die on my own terms. That is the honest truth.”
                                      He reckons that in life, everyone is just doing their job, and he ﬁrmly believes that “If I win, we all win. If I lose,
                                   only I lose.” Hence, two years ago, he decided that he had had enough. “This is my life and I shouldn’t compromise
                                   any further.”

               I WOULD FEEL QUITE EMPTY, AS IF NOTHING IS RELIABLE

                           AND THAT I CAN ONLY RELY ON MYSELF.



            I DON’T LIKE ANYTHING THAT’S PRETENTIOUS
            Jackson’s parents are both athletes. When he was 10, he fell in love with fencing while attending a recreational
            class in primary school. He followed in his father’s footsteps and chose sabre fencing as his discipline. When he
            was 17, Jackson came in ﬁrst in the Asian Junior Fencing Championships. In his sporting life, he won an Asian
            championship, three national championships, and nine international and Hong Kong championships.
               He confesses, “At that time, I was a go-getter.” It seemed then that he was destined for an athletic career. This
            was followed by a stint abroad as a trainee, and he had to live independently at a young age. Pensive, he adds,
            “I’ve experienced a lot of failures, and I am still experiencing them now.” That, however, has not stopped him.
            In fact, like a true sportsman, it has strengthened his resolve when he is confronted with failure. He explains, “If
            I want this, what are the skills I need? And how do I acquire those skills?” Once he has it ﬁgured out, he invests
            the time required, dissects it, and trains for it. He adds, “I can’t let myself fail because of others.”
               In the eyes of the audience, Jackson’s unique selling point is being “normal,” and this normalcy has multiple
            layers, including being well-mannered, even-tempered, emotionally stable, dedicated, and appropriate—to the
            extent that some have labelled him “pretentious.”
               Jackson has never heard of anyone calling him pretentious. He shares, “If it’s an act, the cat will let itself out
            of the bag eventually. More than 90 percent of the time, I don’t really have a temper because I’m quite easy. I
            can eat anything, go anywhere, do anything. But if it involves work that I’m invested in, then I can’t let it go. So,
            I do have my emotions, but if I am not triggered, then I‘m all good.”
               Joy, he says, comes from spending time with his friends and completing projects that have been on his mind.
               “People change. I think time is not the determinant of how truthful a friendship is. It’s possible that you can
            be friends with someone for over a decade and only then realise what kind of person they truly are. But I do think
            there are some conversations, regardless of the duration, that spark magic. I have a couple of instances like this
            when our schedules align and we have time to talk, we spend three to ﬁve days together, and we discuss things
            that resonate with us. It’s a kind of positive energy—it’s supportive of you, and doesn’t care what your job is. It’s
            transparent, direct, and sincere conversation that happens between people,” he shares.
               Despite coming across as “normal,” Jackson has an air of mystery about him. While he is a charismatic singer
            and performer, he doesn’t brag, nor mention the effort he puts in behind the scenes, or show off the drafts and
            the documentaries. His dazzling stage persona, and the concealment of his hard work makes everything appear
            effortless—perhaps this is the reason why he has been unkindly labelled “pretentious.”
               Jackson shrugs, “I don’t care; what matters to me is the moment. I don’t need others to know, and they might
            not be interested in the happenings behind the scenes. I just feel uncomfortable when I hear those words, my
            heart sinks a little.
               “You see, I’m pretty straightforward. I don’t like politics and I don’t judge by appearance, so I don’t like things
            that are pretentious.”

            I WANT TO MAKE MY OWN HISTORY
            When Jackson is not working, he is at home, with his parents in Shanghai. The conversation on ageing crops up
            time and again, with the refrain that being 29 is considered old to him. Although his hours are irregular, he now
            consciously clocks six hours of sleep, an improvement from four hours in the past. Before, he could still function
            on three to four hours of sleep. “But now I have come to realise that I’m limited too,” he quips.
               Compared to the fresh and youthful look he had when he ﬁrst debuted, Jackson looks more world-weary.
            Labels such as “young hunk” and “little puppy” are long gone; in place are new layers, courtesy of his lived
            experience. Today’s Jackson wears many hats—singer, rapper, fashion designer, competitive captain, athlete—
            personas that attract many who want to scratch beneath the surface and uncover the rich, sensitive heart behind
            these identities.
               Jackson’s only setback, he believes, is not having a hit song that he can call his own. But he is unfazed,
            “Actually, it’s not entirely a failure. After all, I have my own community, I’m still a musician. I’m not motivated to
            just create a hit song, so I think it’s okay. I believe, one day my community will be able to resonate with this.”
               Ever positive, he has set a milestone for himself—at 35. Not to retire, but to try new things, or explore new
            areas, such as working behind the scenes, or working on creatives for others. “I am very rational, and I’m conﬁdent
            because these are things that I genuinely enjoy. I get a lot of satisfaction from working behind the scenes, even if   TRANSLATION: TARIN TEO
            it means staying up all night till six or seven in the morning. Although it’s a painful process, it’s okay, because once
            it’s completed, I’ll suddenly come to realise how happy I am. And that is one of the reasons worth living for.”
