Barbie-isms have been                            littering our language of late and you would be hard pressed to not see the plethora of Pepto                            Bismol pink that’s been colouring all our outfits and phones since the launch of this movie in                            late July. While many may see Barbie as the quintessential bombshell of a woman, she actually                            is far more than her blonde mane and impossibly long legs. I have yet to see the movie but                            I’ve been so impressed with the reviews and, of course, the legendary Ken doll. My namesake                            (played by the ultra dashing Ryan Gosling) with the perfect set of abs (I want!) sports some of                            the best candy-coloured fashion. Get Ken-spired with the best in pastels on pages 28 and 29,                            where ultra-feminine looks and some of the glitziest and shiniest fashion will make you stand                            out like a doll.                               I believe fashion should always have a dopamine effect for the wearer—even if it’s all black.                            Happiness cannot simply be seen sartorially as bright, happy colours. That would be far too                            #basic. Take inspo from our pages of feel-good fashion on page 122—they will literally inspire                            you to leap for joy. Our cover girl this month is Thai singer Minnie of the K-pop band (G)I-DLE.                            Her story, on page 114, of how she moved countries and picked up four languages in pursuit of                            a thriving career in music should be an inspiration to all of us. Minnie also sports some of the                            cutest, most feminine fashion from Miu Miu, which brings back all the coquettishness of Barbie                            in our real world. There are other new looks to refresh your wardrobe—read our trend report on                            page 36. This season, bold reds take centre stage, while quiet luxury in the form of plain suitings                            in luxe fabrics and puffer coats are on the rise, as is ultra sexy lingerie dressing—all guaranteed                            to give you major Kenergy.                               And  on  the  need  for  positive  fashion—our  power  list  this  year  is  eight  women  who  are                            Singapore’s  comedy  queens.  These  funny  girls  have  the  courage,  flair  and  smarts  to  break                            gender barriers. They embody the theme of this issue—rule breakers and daredevils. Read the                            stories of these brave hearts on page 44.                               And one final word on rule breakers—remember when Madonna shocked the world with her                            near naked cavorting, F-bomb-filled lyrics and explosive videos that pulled the curtains on so   PHOTOGRAPHY: ERWAN ALEXANDRE JEAN.

She provoked in the ’80s all the way through to present day—that’s over four                            decades of rule breaking. So for me to hear lyrics spewed by today’s Gen Z musicians who think                            an F-bomb in a song makes you a rebel—let me tell you, it does not.

McQueen himself famously got his start             on London’s famed Savile             Row, and the rigour of             English bespoke tailoring             has informed the House’s             output ever since. Sarah             Burton’s fall/winter 2023             collection for the brand             was a compelling exploration             of shape, expressed through             cloth in relation to the human             form.

Whether we             made them laugh or cry, they felt             something. It’s extra meaningful when it             comes from the younger ones because             growing up, I loved watching actors and             performers on stage, and now years down             the road, to hear that I am inspiring the             younger generation makes me feel like I’m             paying something forward,” says Siti on             what drives her. One of the most proliﬁc             stage actors in the country today, Siti’s             journey into the arts scene wasn’t             conventional—her academic background             is in building and drafting—but then again,             she is used to defying conventions. Her             triumphs in theatre feel even sweeter             because they’ve also served to challenge             society’s narrow beauty ideals. “Being a             plus-size girl myself, [what I do] is also to             tell the youth who may not be deemed             as ‘normal-sized’ that this is a safe             environment where we are accepted             based on our talent, not our looks.”             Power, for Siti, only means             something when it’s coupled with             purpose. “It’s about having             something strong that others           MAKEUP: MANISA TAN.

Her foray into the arena happened on a whim—a frequent audience member at open-mic                 nights, she decided to take to the stage one night as a self-set challenge. The crowd lapped up her set and something a                 tourist who was in the audience said stuck with her speciﬁcally. “She told me, ‘I don’t want to come to China and watch a                 comedy show where a bunch of foreigners talk about China. I want to hear from someone like you’. That has served as                 something of an unofficial mission statement for Peng ever since. “Comedy is very male-dominated. There are already so                 many white male comedians. I want to see more Asian women on the stage. Comedy can be a tool to give a voice and                 platform to people who don’t have them. Especially here in Asia, there are a lot of people who look like me, but on the                 stage, I’m always the minority. So through my comedy, I can make people hear not just me, but all of us Asian women.”                                                     48 HARPER’S BAZAAR AUGUST 2023","Blazer, Sportmax.

What I’ve             realised about myself is that I love             to do audience interaction. I love             speaking to people and stringing             a story together on the spot. A lot             of comedians are writers, and for             me l love impromptu comedy             more than written comedy.” And           MAKEUP AND HAIR: ANDREA JOAN DOM USING KIMCHI CHIC BEAUTY   The bravest thing she’s done of             while Channa is always assured in             her stand-up routines, there are             still things that make her nervous.              late?

How could we not? Ang is the OG when it             comes to Singaporean women in comedy. She became a household name, thanks to her 10-year stint as Rosie Phua on Phua Chu             Kang. Since then, Ang has continued acting and hosting in addition to founding FLY Entertainment—a talent management             company—and a string of F\&B businesses. The “serial entrepreneurship,” as she calls it, stems from her passion for “building things,             and watching people grow.” It is also informed by her tumultuous childhood. “Because of my family background, I’ve learned to             always have a backup plan.” Her formative years have also helped Ang hone her iconic brand of humour. “You need to be able to see             the brighter side of things, and to laugh at yourself,” she says. She has parlayed that ability into a long career in entertainment,             though she believes that more can be done about artists and creatives being compensated fairly. “Everything I bring to the table is             accumulated over 30 years of experience. You can get someone cheaper, but can they connect to the audience in the same way?”                                                     51 HARPER’S BAZAAR AUGUST 2023","BAZAAR SPECIAL

The debut             sees the first 13 in two acts—geology and             life. Rare, no-oil Colombian emeralds take             centre stage for the Gondwana suite,             which is representative of one of two             supercontinents before the Earth was             reshaped. Catastrophic themes named             Volcano, Wave and Rupture are             expressed through the Maison’s signature             graphic design elements, leaning into the             custom-cut “LV” stones. The sun and the             sea, without which life would not exist, are also celebrated with a             chapter punctuated with yellow sapphires and aquamarines. The             second act explores the intricacies of life observed from seeds to             fossils, inspiring the emphasis on textures, layers and enchanting                            stones throughout the collection.

The aquatic fantasy featuring some of the world’s most pristine gems             celebrates the late, great designer Jean Schlumberger’s fascination with             the sea and sea denizens, re-envisioning his wondrous oceanic pieces from             the Tiffany vault.                 “Jean Schlumberger referenced the seabed and its riches many times             throughout his creative repertoire. For this collection, we identiﬁed core              subjects from this arsenal and designed the chapters around each,” says                chief artistic officer Nathalie Verdeille of her ﬁrst Blue Book collection.                “Then, the emblematic research of each theme began: a true deep             dive into the iconic pieces, images, colours and materials that would              eventually deﬁne the visual lexicon of this beautiful collection.”                Before Verdeille’s arrival, Tiffany \& Co. was no stranger to giving new              life to Schlumberger’s work.

These exquisite pieces make up the summer release along with six more themes—Pisces, corals,                                               starﬁsh, sea star, star urchin and shell—where other innovations are implemented through transformable                                              designs and novel engineering.                                                 The shell theme explores the three-dimensionality of objects sculpted by the sea, imperfect yet                                              beautiful nonetheless. The key piece features a diamond-encrusted seashell treasure hiding a 21-carat                                              black opal, which can be worn four ways—as a brooch, a necklace, a pendant with the shell or simply                                              with the opal alone.                                                  Jewels resembling star urchins are deﬁned by the hand-carved chalcedony spikes, which mimic                                              the animal’s protective armour. Each spike is set with a spring mechanism, echoing the tremble that                                              the real deal does in water—an impressive feat that even Schlumberger would be proud of.                                                 “We are guardians of the temple of the House of Tiffany, and of Jean Schlumberger’s legacy.

When it comes to making             if-you-know-you-know fashion, he             is the current undisputed master of             the fashion optical illusion—most             famously, with those leather trousers             and shirts painstakingly printed to             look like denim, flannels and ribbed             cottons. This season, he extended             his trompe l’oeil wizardry and the             ateliers’ leatherworking prowess to             accessories. There were soft knitted             slipper  socks  that were actually             leather. But most arresting of all were             the plain brown shoppers that looked             like any old paper bag, but were             actually crafted from supple calfskin             made to look like brown paper. The             insides were suede and the handles             are also leather, ﬁnely braided.

The quintessential question that I ask myself                      past few years has been a cultural hotrod      all the time, and people I care about, is, “Hey, if the sun is shining on                      when it was spearheaded by Virgil Abloh,        you, what would you do with the light?” When the sun shined on me                      the visionary disruptor, needed someone         for an opportunity like this, it changed my life.

I started working in music and as things                                                                          evolved, I met Marc Jacobs. In 2004, he asked Nigo and me                                                                          to collaborate on the Millionaire sunglasses. In 2008, Pietro                                                                          Beccari, who was at Louis Vuitton at the time, asked me to                                                                           design a jewellery collection for the House. My ﬁrst foray into                                                                           fashion was because of Marc’s generosity, and it only grew                                                                           from my relationship with Pietro. Over the years, we stayed                                                                           in touch. When he offered me the job as Men’s creative                                                                            director, I was excited, not only for the job, but to work                                                                            with him again.                                                                             In your show notes, you pay tribute to “the giant                                                                             before me.” Can you tell us a little more about that?

He left a lot of hits with                                                                             the House. As far as I’m concerned, I’m collaborating                                                                              with his spirit. When he got this appointment, I was                                                                              really happy for him. Right until he started here, we                                                                              were working together on JOOPITER, this online auction                                                                              space we had. It was crazy what the connections were,                                                                               and the respect he had for us, and which we continue                                                                               to have for him. I can tell you that Virgil and I being                                                                               here has to say to kids who look like us, “Oh, I can do                                                                                anything.

So many of                                                                                  us are being swept up from one place and landing                                                                                  in fertile soil in other places, and being treated                                                                                  and watered and sunned like all souls should be.                                                                                  I can say there is an impact in that way, which is                                                                                   changing. It’s not enough, but it’s happening.

Chua also muses that the Covid-19 pandemic was a catalyst for                                                         her change of heart. During the lockdown, she spent most of her time indoors                                                         at her old house. “It made me realise how important having a peaceful and                                                         comfortable lifestyle at home is,” she explains. “When we were stuck at                                                         home, we needed a space that felt comfortable, offered activities, and had                                                         a good view—all of which I did not have back then.”                                                            Today, her life is an intriguing duality—on social media, her personality is                                                         larger-than-life, but at home, she relishes her privacy.                                                            Stepping into her home is akin to entering a grand French salon. The                                                         almost entirely white three-storied residence takes up approximately 740                                                         square metres of space. Upon entering, one’s eyes are instantly drawn to the                                                         distinctive arches lining the ceiling, their contours playing with light and                                                         shadow. In the distance, wall-to-wall glass-panelled doors offer a tantalising                                                         glimpse of the waters beyond, ﬁlling the entranceway with a serene light that                                                         accentuates the chiaroscuro effect throughout the space.                                                            When it came to the interior design of her home, Chua knew exactly what                                                         she wants. “My brief was clear—I wanted the decor to resemble the                                                         Dior boutique at Avenue Montaigne in Paris. I did my research and studied                                                         their design.”                                                            Like her personality, her home embodies attention to detail and a                                                         relentless pursuit of individuality. “My travels have always been my                                                         inspiration, and Paris is one of my favourite cities,” she declares. Her home,                                                         with its Parisian chic and elegance, is a testament to her love for the city.                                                            “The beauty of Paris always leaves me mesmerised,” she states. “The                                                         city’s fashion, the food, the art—everything adds to my creative process.

Chua shares that these panels were not pre-             bought but were personally chosen and arranged to achieve the desired             effect. The resulting design is unique, with some elements protruding while             others are recessed, providing a visual and tactile experience.                Working with the principal architect and co-founder of Type0             Architecture, Chua recalls it was a hands-on, creative exploration process.             “They would bring me all these strips of wood, and there I would be, putting it             all together,” she says, reminiscing about the satisfying process of seeing her             vision come to life.                Given her eye for perfection and the many details that needed attending             to, the extensive renovation process took considerable time—a year and a             half, in fact.                In Chua’s home, every room is a distinct entity, carefully designed and             compartmentalised to serve its purpose. She appreciates this clear             delineation of spaces. “This layout offers a sense of structure and             organisation, yet each room is a part of the whole.”                “I designed this house with content creation in mind because every part             of the house can be a backdrop,” she declares with a proud smile.                She recalls when content creation was not as seamless, “I used to rent a             studio each time I needed to create content for my clients.”                But that’s in the past. Today, having a space serving multiple purposes             was more than just creating a beautiful home. For Chua, it was also an             intelligent business decision. “For example, if a client offers a supplement, I             don’t have to rent a studio because I can do it right here,” she adds.                The dining area and open-plan kitchen elegantly coalesce within a shared             space, subtly divided by a versatile movable island. The thoughtful design             encapsulates Chua’s practical sense, especially critical when it comes to             hosting—a favourite pastime she shares with her partner, lawyer Terence Koh.                Adjacent to the 8-seater Georgetti dining table set that is anchored by a             Baccarat crystal chandelier hanging above, a handsome wine chiller ﬂaunts             an impressive selection of vintages, including the revered labels of Chateau             Mouton Rothschild, Petrus and Chateau Margaux. The six-door chiller also             serves as a reﬁned backdrop, lending an air of sophistication to the area. Yet,             despite her splendid wine collection, Chua reveals her preference for             champers. “Actually, I am more of a champagne person,” she dilvuges,             expressing a fondness for the crisp and vibrant notes of Ruinart Blanc de             Blancs. This disclosure not only underlines her distinctive preferences but             also adds a whimsical dimension to the overall narrative.                                                     89 HARPER’S BAZAAR AUGUST 2023","A FASHIONABLE LIFE                                                                                                                         “It is important that everyone can see what is happening.

Venturing into the back garden, and beyond the lap pool, we meet an                                                         unexpected sight: a chicken coop.

Peter Philips, the visionary creative and image director of Dior makeup, explains                                                         his inspiration for the Dior Forever cushions, “We wanted to create a cushion that                                                         gives a ﬂawless makeup result, is non-transferrable, but still extremely hydrating, so                                                          you get this feeling that it’s caring for your skin when you wear it.” And we absolutely                                                         agree. The best cushion foundations should be seen, not felt — all while the formula                                                         does magic in helping skin feel better at the end of the day. After all, makeup sits on                                                         the skin for a good part of the day, it makes sense that they’re helping to hydrate                                                          and reﬁne the complexion.                                                              The Dior Forever Cushion offers a velvety, non-transferable matte ﬁnish, while                                                         the Dior Forever Skin Glow Cushion imparts a radiant and luminous glow. What                                                         impresses most is their formula’s adaptability to the skin, revealing each individual’s                                                         natural luminosity with sheer elegance, all while providing 24-hour wear without                                                         any dryness.

Moreover, the                                                         thoughtful infusion of ﬂoral extracts ensures long-lasting hydration while preserving                                                          the skin’s inherent beauty.

With Rouge Blush, each woman can build the colour, from             an ultra-natural looking result that is almost invisible, to a really intense look.” The             versatility of Rouge Blush allows for personalised expression, taking into account             every woman’s unique look, style and preference.

Petite and doll-like in person, with beautiful features and immaculate skin,                                                one wonders if her cute nickname has anything to do with her stature. Beneath the perfect                                                package lies a talented musician (she plays the piano and is keen to learn guitar), composer                                                (she writes several of the band’s songs) and polyglot (she speaks Korean, English, Chinese                                                and Japanese, as well as her native Thai.)                                     To understand Minnie’s career in music, one needs to delve a bit deeper into her upbringing and family                                  background. Minnie grew up with a musical mum. She says, “My ﬁrst memory of music is my mum playing                                  piano. My mum is really, really good at playing the piano and she plays it every day.” In fact, Minnie’s mother                                  taught her piano from the age of four and her uncle, Nat Yontararak, is a classical pianist, composer and                                  music teacher. It’s safe to say that music runs in her blood, or at least has been a big part of her life since                                  she was young.                                     Her early musical inspirations included singer-songwriters who happened to play the piano like Vanessa                                  Carlton and Alicia Keys. Seeing her daughter’s interest in both piano and singing, Minnie’s mum began                                  sending her for weekly vocal lessons from the age of six at a music academy, which she attended all the way                                  to the auditioning stage of her career. Shy at ﬁrst, Minnie’s mum rewarded her if she performed on stage,                                  giving her the push to explore her talent and share it with a wider audience.                                     Today  as  a  member  of  (G)I-DLE,  Minnie  is  living  the  dream.  She  was  recently  named  a  Miu  Miu                                  ambassador. On the Asian leg of a world tour with the group at the time of our shoot, she was looking                                  forward to a homecoming of sorts when the band performed in her native Thailand for their Bangkok date                                  in mid-July. These sweet reminders of how far the group has come has been a highlight for Minnie. “We                                  started in Seoul a few weeks ago, and Taipei was our second stop. And it was Shu Hua’s (her (G)I-DLE                                  bandmate) hometown. And it was the ﬁrst time we performed a concert there. Shu Hua cried, and I was                                  kind of surprised as I don’t see her cry often. I was so proud of her because she looked so happy and so                                  nervous at the same time,” she shares. And having experienced the same mix of emotions, Minnie could                                  understand her bandmate’s feelings. “And I can understand her. Because last year when we performed in                                  Bangkok, I cried a lot. It was a dream come true. It was not the ﬁrst time we were performing there, but it                                  was the ﬁrst time we had our own concert. My parents, friends, everyone was there and I was really touched.                                  It was very emotional.”                                     Beyond performing, Minnie also composes some of the band’s songs. On her process she says. “I write                                  the melody ﬁrst. And then I’ll write the lyrics after. So when I recorded the demo for ‘Paradise’, I was just                                  humming  ‘dice, dice.’ And then I’ll ﬁnd a word that kind of rhymes or matches with the humming that I                                  recorded. So it became the word ‘paradise’ that I chose to write about.” For Minnie, part of the writing                                  process is creating music that her fans can relate to as they are a large source of her inspiration. In the                                  lyrics for the chorus, Minnie says the line, “Every time I look into those angel eyes,” is about the feeling of                                  inspiration she gets when she looks at her fans. She tells us that for the song “Lucid” she was inspired by                                  Scooby-Doo as the music had a horror undertone, but in a cute way.                                     While her songwriting has improved since her debut, Minnie reveals that she still asks her producers for                                  advice on writing Korean lyrics. “I think I’m more conﬁdent writing the melody,” she quips. “I come up with                                  something catchy and then if it’s good, I’ll just go with it.” As for conﬁdence in her personal life and stage                                  persona, Minnie says that she is still a work in progress. “I wasn’t a conﬁdent girl. But I think I’ve grown                                  together with my group members. Our members’ auras are very energetic, so they inspire me a lot. When                                  I’m with them, I’m very comfortable.” Ever the professional, Minnie says that constant practising and honing                                  her skills is part of gaining that self-assurance when performing.                                     Proud of her Thai heritage, Minnie is impressed by her Neverlands (the nickname for (G)I-DLE’s fans)                                  some of whom have even started to learn Thai because of her. Being a polyglot, Minnie shares that she                                  sometimes thinks in different languages, which can prove challenging if she is doing an interview in English                                  as she is for Harper’s BAZAAR today. Currently she is thinking in Korean, but if she is in a country like the                                  US, her English gets better. Coincidentally the band released an English single in July.  Future plans for                                  Minnie include a chance to collaborate with Australian singer Troye Sivan, who she admires greatly, as well                                  as singer Justin Bieber. But for now she this multilingual and multi-talented star is enjoying the ride.                                                    119 HARPER’S BAZAAR AUGUST 2023","120 HARPER’S BAZAAR AUGUST 2023","Dress; rings; stockings; Miu Miu             OPPOSITE: Dress; earrings;             rings; necklace, Miu Miu.
