                                                    THERE TRULY IS NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT, but one of
                                                    the great challenges of life in 2023 seems to be finding ways to
                                                    actually be present—wholly and fully immersed in the moment.
                                                    And this is quite a moment we’re in right now. We’re no longer
                                                    living in the past; that much is evident. But it also often feels as
                                                    if we haven’t quite reached the future. Crucial new doors are
                                                    being opened, but others always seem to be closing. One day can
                                                    appear to be the dawn of a new era, then the next seems like an
                                                    unsettling return to old, antiquated ways. The world feels smaller
                                                    but also more divided. We’re dreaming and reckoning. Things
                                                    begin and end. We’re forced to start over—again. Some people get
                                                    tired. Some get lost. Others try to wait it out or get it over with.
                                                    Some, though, see an opportunity in all the uncertainty. They see

                                                    potential and possibility. They see a path forward. The individ-
                                                    uals we spotlight in our annual Icons issues are members of that
                                                    last group. They are people who are helping to shift narratives,
                                                    open doors, and reshape the culture. What makes them icons is
                                                    a question of influence and impact but also one of identity—of
                                                    who we are and what we aspire to, of how we see and understand
                                                    ourselves. They aren’t just of the moment—they are seizing it and
                                                    making it their own. HB

                “When something is ICONIC, it’s RECOGNIZABLE to people who don’t have detailed knowledge of it,”

               debut EP, Sundanza, in 2010, Sampha has been tapped by the                 “Cranes in the Sky.” “I got to do multiple sessions with her—in

               It has been said that WE LIVE in an ATTENTION ECONOMY, where POWER and INFLUENCE are
               often  determined  by  what  GRABS  and  ARRESTS  us  most  fully,  whether  it’s  a  30-second  TIKTOK

               video,  a  stirring  PERFORMANCE,  a  transporting  PIECE  of  WRITING,  or  a  call  for  JUSTICE.
               That’s why where we choose to INVEST our ATTENTION is so vitally IMPORTANT. The individuals

               in  this  year’s  ICONS  portfolio  are  people  who  COMMAND  it.  They  CAPTIVATE  us,  CONNECT
               us,  ENTERTAIN  us,  MOVE  us,  stoke  our  OBSESSION,  and  INSPIRE  us  with  the  URGENCY  they
               bring  to  their  WORK.  They  not  only  speak  to  this  MOMENT,  they  are  also  helping  to  DEFINE  it

               and  GIVE  it  MEANING.  They’ve  each  made  their  MARKS—and  some  of  them  might  be  MAKING
               HISTORY. But most IMPORTANTLY, they all understand what can happen when our EYES, HEARTS,

               MINDS, and ENERGIES are all pointed in the same DIRECTION.

                                  experiences as Holocaust survivors, has been taught in classrooms across the country since its
                                  publication in 1986. It has also frequently been the subject of bans, notably in January 2022, when
                                  the McMinn County school board in Tennessee removed the novel from its eighth-grade curriculum.
